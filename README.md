# VetCoin (VETC)
VetCoin is more than a token—it’s a mission in motion. Built by veterans, for the military community, VetCoin is designed to reward loyalty, drive real-world adoption, and uplift those who’ve served. Every transaction fuels a bigger purpose: supporting housing initiatives for unhoused veterans. We're pushing for merchant integration, small business adoption, and utility that matters. No hype. Just roots, grit, and vision.
